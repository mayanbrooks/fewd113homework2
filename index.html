			<p> The series revolves around four older, single women (three windows and one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Deveraux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both repsonded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dororthy's mother, Sophia Petrillo, after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.[6][7]</p>
